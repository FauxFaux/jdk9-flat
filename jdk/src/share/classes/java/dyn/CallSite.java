/**
 * An {@code invokedynamic} call site, as reified by the
 * containing class's bootstrap method.
 * Every call site object corresponds to a distinct instance
 * of the <code>invokedynamic</code> instruction, and vice versa.
 * Every call site has one state variable, called the {@code target}.
 * It is typed as a {@link MethodHandle}.  This state is never null, and
 * it is the responsibility of the bootstrap method to produce call sites
 * which have been pre-linked to an initial target method.
 * <p>
 * (Note:  The bootstrap method may elect to produce call sites of a
 * language-specific subclass of {@code CallSite}.  In such a case,
 * the subclass may claim responsibility for initializing its target to
 * a non-null value, by overriding {@link #initialTarget}.)
 * <p>
 * An {@code invokedynamic} instruction which has not yet been executed
 * is said to be <em>unlinked</em>.  When an unlinked call site is executed,
 * the containing class's bootstrap method is called to manufacture a call site,
 * for the instruction.  If the bootstrap method does not assign a non-null
 * value to the new call site's target variable, the method {@link #initialTarget}
 * is called to produce the new call site's first target method.
