/**
 * Service-provider class for file systems.
 *
 * <p> A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 * implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
 * identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
 * is identified by the URI scheme "file". It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
 * provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
 * The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
 * and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
 * may be overridden if the system property {@code
 * java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
 * provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
 * FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
 * that initializes the provider.
 *
 * <p> A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
 * file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 * the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
 * is identified by the URI {@code "file:///"}. A memory-based file system,
 * for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code "memory:///?name=logfs"}.
 * The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 * system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 * obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 * a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 * if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 * the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 * provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.
 *
 * <p> In addition to file systems, a provider is also a factory for {@link
 * FileChannel} and {@link AsynchronousFileChannel} channels. The {@link
 * #newFileChannel newFileChannel} and {@link #newAsynchronousFileChannel
 * AsynchronousFileChannel} methods are defined to open or create files, returning
 * a channel to access the file. These methods are invoked by static factory
 * methods defined in the {@link java.nio.channels} package.
 *
 * <p> All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.
 *
 * @since 1.7
