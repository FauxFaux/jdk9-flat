/**
 * A file reference that locates a file using a system dependent path. The file
 * is not required to exist.
 *
 * <p> On many platforms a <em>path</em> is the means to locate and access files
 * in a file system. A path is hierarchical and composed of a sequence of
 * directory and file name elements separated by a special separator or
 * delimiter.
 *
 * <h4>Path operations</h4>
 *
 * <p> A system dependent path represented by this class is conceptually a
 * sequence of name elements and optionally a <em>root component</em>. The name
 * that is <em>farthest</em> from the root of the directory hierarchy is the
 * name of a file or directory. The other elements are directory names. The root
 * component typically identifies a file system hierarchy. A {@code Path} can
 * represent a root, a root and a sequence of names, or simply one or more name
 * elements. It defines the {@link #getName() getName}, {@link #getParent
 * getParent}, {@link #getRoot getRoot}, and {@link #subpath subpath} methods
 * to access the components or a subsequence of its name elements.
 *
 * <p> In addition to accessing the components of a path, a {@code Path} also
 * defines {@link #resolve(Path) resolve} and {@link #relativize relativize}
 * operations. Paths can also be {@link #compareTo compared}, and tested
 * against each other using using the {@link #startsWith startsWith} and {@link
 * #endsWith endWith} methods.
 *
 * <h4>File operations</h4>
 *
 * <p> A {@code Path} is either <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em>. An
 * absolute path is complete in that does not need to be combined with another
 * path in order to locate a file. All operations on relative paths are first
 * resolved against a file system's default directory as if by invoking the
 * {@link #toAbsolutePath toAbsolutePath} method.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the operations defined by the {@link FileRef} interface,
 * this class defines the following operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #newByteChannel newByteChannel} method
 *     may be used to open a file and obtain a byte channel for reading or
 *     writing. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> Files may be {@link #createFile(FileAttribute[]) created}, or
 *     directories may be {@link #createDirectory(FileAttribute[]) created}.
 *     </p></li>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #delete delete} method may be used to delete a file.
 *     </p></li>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #checkAccess checkAccess} method may be used to check
 *     the existence or accessibility of a file. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #isSameFile isSameFile} method may be used to test if
 *     two file references locate the same file. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #getFileStore getFileStore} method may be used to
 *     obtain the {@link FileStore} representing the storage where a file is
 *     located. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> Directories can be {@link #newDirectoryStream opened} so as to
 *      iterate over the entries in the directory. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> Files can be {@link #copyTo(Path,CopyOption[]) copied} or
 *     {@link #moveTo(Path,CopyOption[]) moved}. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> Symbolic-links may be {@link #createSymbolicLink created}, or the
 *     target of a link may be {@link #readSymbolicLink read}. </p></li>
 *   <li><p> The {@link #toRealPath real} path of an existing file may be
 *     obtained. </li></p>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> This class implements {@link Watchable} interface so that a directory
 * located by a path can be {@link #register registered} with a {@link WatchService}.
 * and entries in the directory watched.
 *
 * <h4>File attributes</h4>
 *
 * In addition to the {@link #setAttribute setAttribute} and {@link #getAttribute
 * getAttribute} methods, the <a href="attribute/package-summary.html">{@code
 * java.nio.file.attribute}</a> package provides type-safe and efficient access
 * to file attributes or <em>meta-data</em> associated with files. The {@link
 * Attributes Attributes} class defines methods that operate on or return file
 * attributes. For example, the file type, size, timestamps, and other
 * <em>basic</em> meta-data are obtained, in bulk, by invoking the {@link
 * Attributes#readBasicFileAttributes Attributes.readBasicFileAttributes} method:
 * <pre>
 *     Path file = ...
 *     BasicFileAttributes attrs = Attributes.readBasicFileAttributes(file);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <a name="interop"><h4>Interoperability</h4></a>
 *
 * <p> Paths created by file systems associated with the default {@link
 * java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider provider} are generally interoperable
 * with the {@link java.io.File java.io.File} class. Paths created by other
 * providers are unlikely to be interoperable with the abstract path names
 * represented by {@code java.io.File}. The {@link java.io.File#toPath
 * File.toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@code Path} from the abstract
 * path name represented by a {@code java.io.File java.io.File} object. The
 * resulting {@code Path} can be used to operate on the same file as the {@code
 * java.io.File} object.
 *
 * <p> Path objects created by file systems associated with the default
 * provider are interoperable with objects created by other file systems created
 * by the same provider. Path objects created by file systems associated with
 * other providers may not be interoperable with other file systems created by
 * the same provider. The reasons for this are provider specific.
 *
 * <h4>Concurrency</h4></a>
 *
 * <p> Instances of this class are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.
