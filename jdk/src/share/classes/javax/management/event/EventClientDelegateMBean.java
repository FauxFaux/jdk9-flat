/**
 * <p>This interface specifies necessary methods on the MBean server
 * side for a JMX remote client to manage its notification listeners as
 * if they are local.
 * Users do not usually work directly with this MBean; instead, the {@link
 * EventClient} class is designed to be used directly by the user.</p>
 *
 * <p>A default implementation of this interface can be added to an MBean
 * Server in one of several ways.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>The most usual is to insert an {@link
 * javax.management.remote.MBeanServerForwarder MBeanServerForwarder} between
 * the {@linkplain javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServer Connector Server}
 * and the MBean Server, that will intercept accesses to the Event Client
 * Delegate MBean and treat them as the real MBean would. This forwarder is
 * inserted by default with the standard RMI Connector Server, and can also
 * be created explicitly using {@link EventClientDelegate#newForwarder()}.
 *
 * <li><p>A variant on the above is to replace the MBean Server that is
 * used locally with a forwarder as described above.  Since
 * {@code MBeanServerForwarder} extends {@code MBeanServer}, you can use
 * a forwarder anywhere you would have used the original MBean Server.  The
 * code to do this replacement typically looks something like this:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();  // or whatever
 * MBeanServerForwarder mbsf = EventClientDelegate.newForwarder();
 * mbsf.setMBeanServer(mbs);
 * mbs = mbsf;
 * // now use mbs just as you did before, but it will have an EventClientDelegate
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li><p>The final way is to create an instance of {@link EventClientDelegate}
 * and register it in the MBean Server under the standard {@linkplain
 * #OBJECT_NAME name}:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();  // or whatever
 * EventClientDelegate ecd = EventClientDelegate.getEventClientDelegate(mbs);
 * mbs.registerMBean(ecd, EventClientDelegateMBean.OBJECT_NAME);
 * <pre>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since JMX 2.0
