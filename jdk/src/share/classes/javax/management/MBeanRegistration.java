/**
 * <p>Can be implemented by an MBean in order to
 * carry out operations before and after being registered or unregistered from
 * the MBean Server.  An MBean can also implement this interface in order
 * to get a reference to the MBean Server and/or its name within that
 * MBean Server.</p>
 *
 * <h4 id="injection">Resource injection</h4>
 *
 * <p>As an alternative to implementing {@code MBeanRegistration}, if all that
 * is needed is the MBean Server or ObjectName then an MBean can use
 * <em>resource injection</em>.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a field in the MBean object has type {@link ObjectName} and has
 * the {@link javax.annotation.Resource &#64;Resource} annotation,
 * then the {@code ObjectName} under which the MBean is registered is
 * assigned to that field during registration.  Likewise, if a field has type
 * {@link MBeanServer} and the <code>&#64;Resource</code> annotation, then it will
 * be set to the {@code MBeanServer} in which the MBean is registered.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Configuration implements ConfigurationMBean {
 *     &#64;Resource
 *     private volatile MBeanServer mbeanServer;
 *     &#64;Resource
 *     private volatile ObjectName objectName;
 *     ...
 *     void unregisterSelf() throws Exception {
 *         mbeanServer.unregisterMBean(objectName);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Resource injection can also be used on fields of type
 * {@link SendNotification} to simplify notification sending.  Such a field
 * will get a reference to an object of type {@code SendNotification} when
 * the MBean is registered, and it can use this reference to send notifications.
 * For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Configuration implements ConfigurationMBean {
 *     &#64;Resource
 *     private volatile SendNotification sender;
 *     ...
 *     private void updated() {
 *         Notification n = new Notification(...);
 *         sender.sendNotification(n);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A field to be injected must not be static.  It is recommended that
 * such fields be declared {@code volatile}.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is also possible to use the <code>&#64;Resource</code> annotation on
 * methods. Such a method must have a {@code void} return type and a single
 * argument of the appropriate type, for example {@code ObjectName}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any number of fields and methods may have the <code>&#64;Resource</code>
 * annotation.  All fields and methods with type {@code ObjectName}
 * (for example) will receive the same {@code ObjectName} value.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resource injection is available for all types of MBeans, not just
 * Standard MBeans.</p>
 *
 * <p>If an MBean implements the {@link DynamicWrapperMBean} interface then
 * resource injection happens on the object returned by that interface's
 * {@link DynamicWrapperMBean#getWrappedObject() getWrappedObject()} method
 * rather than on the MBean object itself.
 *
 * <p>Resource injection happens after the {@link #preRegister preRegister}
 * method is called (if any), and before the MBean is actually registered
 * in the MBean Server. If a <code>&#64;Resource</code> method throws
 * an exception, the effect is the same as if {@code preRegister} had
 * thrown the exception. In particular it will prevent the MBean from being
 * registered.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resource injection can be used on a field or method where the type
 * is a parent of the injected type, if the injected type is explicitly
 * specified in the <code>&#64;Resource</code> annotation.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     &#64;Resource(type = MBeanServer.class)
 *     private volatile MBeanServerConnection mbsc;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Formally, suppose <em>R</em> is the type in the <code>&#64;Resource</code>
 * annotation and <em>T</em> is the type of the method parameter or field.
 * Then one of <em>R</em> and <em>T</em> must be a subtype of the other
 * (or they must be the same type).  Injection happens if this subtype
 * is {@code MBeanServer}, {@code ObjectName}, or {@code SendNotification}.
 * Otherwise the <code>&#64;Resource</code> annotation is ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resource injection in MBeans is new in version 2.0 of the JMX API.</p>
 *
 * @since 1.5
