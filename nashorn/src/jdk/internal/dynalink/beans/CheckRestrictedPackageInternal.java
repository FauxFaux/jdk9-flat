/**
 * A utility class to check whether a given class is in a package with restricted access e.g. "sun.*". These packages
 * are normally listed in the security property "package.access" for most JRE implementations, although we fortunately
 * don't rely on it but solely on {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess(String)}).
 *
 * This class accomplishes the check in a fashion that works reliably even if Dynalink itself (and all the code on the
 * stack that led to the invocation) has the permission to access the restricted package.
 *
 * If Dynalink has a broad set of privileges (notably, it is loaded from boot or extension class path), then it loads
 * the {@link RestrictedPackageTester} class into a isolated secure class loader that gives it no permissions
 * whatsoever, and uses this completely unprivileged class to subsequently invoke
 * {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess(String)}. This will reliably throw a {@link SecurityException} for every
 * restricted package even if Dynalink and other code on the stack have the requisite {@code "accessClassInPackage.*"}
 * {@link RuntimePermission} privilege.
 *
 * On the other hand, if Dynalink does not have a broad set of privileges normally granted by the boot or extension
 * class path, it will probably lack the privilege to create a new secure class loader into which to load the tester
 * class. In this case, it will invoke {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess(String)} itself with the reasoning that
 * it will also be sufficient to discover whether a package is restricted or not.
 *
 * The rationale for this design is that if Dynalink is running as part of a privileged classpath - boot or extension
 * class path, it will have all privileges, so a security manager's package access check might succeed if all other code
 * on the stack when requesting linking with a particular restricted class is also privileged. A subsequent linking
 * request from less privileged code would then also succeed in requesting methods in privileged package. On the other
 * hand, if Dynalink is privileged, it will be able to delegate the package access check to the unprivileged class and
 * narrow the access based on its result. Finally, if Dynalink itself is unprivileged, it will not be able to load the
 * unprivileged class, but then it will also fail the security manager's package access.
 *
 * With this design, Dynalink effectively restrains itself from giving unauthorized access to restricted packages from
 * classes doing the linking in case it itself has access to those packages. The only way to defeat it would be to
 * selectively give Dynalink some {@code "accessClassInPackage.*"} permissions while denying it the privilege to
 * manipulate class loaders.
