# When you run the tests using a recent build of JDK and -Xbootclasspath/p:JAR
# some tests may fail. Specifically, javac has a test which verifies the content
# of the version string by comparing it against a value that is derived from
# the JRE version string. This file can be given to jtreg to exclude such tests.
# It should *NOT* be used in full SQE runs.
