'hsdis':  A HotSpot plugin for disassembling dynamically generated code.

The files in this directory (Makefile, hsdis.[ch], hsdis-demo.c)
are built independently of the HotSpot JVM.

To use the plugin with a JVM, you need a new version that can load it.
If the product mode of your JVM does not accept -XX:+PrintAssembly,
you do not have a version that is new enough.

* Building

To build this project you need a build of Gnu binutils to link against.
It is known to work with binutils 2.17.

The makefile looks for this build in $BINUTILS, or (if that is not set),
in  .../binutils-2.17-$LIBARCH, where LIBARCH (as in HotSpot) is one of
the jre subdirectory keywords i386, amd64, sparc, sparcv9, etc.

To build Gnu binutils, first download a copy of the software:
  http://directory.fsf.org/project/binutils/

Unpack the binutils tarball into an empty directory:
  chdir ../../../../..
  tar -xzf - < ../binutils-2.17.tar.gz
  mv binutils-2.17 binutils-2.17-i386  #or binutils-2.17-sparc
  cd binutils-2.17-i386

From inside that directory, run configure and make:
  ( export CFLAGS='-fPIC'
    ./configure i386-pc-elf )
  gnumake

(Leave out or change the argument to configure if not on an i386 system.)

Next, untar again into another empty directory for the LP64 version:
  chdir ..
  tar -xzf - < ../binutils-2.17.tar.gz
  mv binutils-2.17 binutils-2.17-amd64  #or binutils-2.17-sparcv9
  cd binutils-2.17-amd64

From inside that directory, run configure for LP64 and make:
  ( export ac_cv_c_bigendian=no CFLAGS='-m64 -fPIC' LDFLAGS=-m64
    ./configure amd64-pc-elf )
  gnumake

The -fPIC option is needed because the generated code will be
linked into the hsdid-$LIBARCH.so binary.  If you miss the
option, the JVM will fail to load the disassembler.

You probably want two builds, one for 32 and one for 64 bits.
To build the 64-bit variation of a platforn, add LP64=1 to
the make command line for hsdis.

So, go back to the hsdis project and build:
  chdir .../hsdis
  gnumake
  gnumake LP64=1

* Installing

Products are named like bin/$OS/hsdis-$LIBARCH.so.
You can install them on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
or inside of your JRE next to $LIBARCH/libjvm.so.

Now test:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH .../hsdis/bin/solaris:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  dargs='-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly'
  dargs=$dargs' -XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=hsdis-print-bytes'
  java $dargs -Xbatch CompileCommand=print,*String.hashCode HelloWorld

If the product mode of the JVM does not accept -XX:+PrintAssembly,
you do not have a version new enough to use the hsdis plugin.
